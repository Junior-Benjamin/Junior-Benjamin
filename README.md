## Hi, Name's Junior


  I'm 19, studying cyber security which I have only the the slightest bit of experience in.
  My aim with this degree is to become a cyber security analyst, so hopefully I'll know if I'm on the right track after a year of making plenty mistakes.

  Things I enjoy?

  Live theatre (Sometimes musical) <br>
  <br>
  Playing guitar / drums <br>
  <br>
  Music in general tbh <br>
  <br>
  Eating <br>
  <br>
  Working out <br>
