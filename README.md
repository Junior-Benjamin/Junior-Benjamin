Hi, I’m Junior

I’m 19 and currently studying Cyber Security - a field I’m just beginning to explore but already feel passionate about. My long-term goal is to become a Cyber Security Analyst. I’m approaching this journey with an open mind and a willingness to learn, knowing that the mistakes I make along the way will shape me into a stronger, more capable professional. By the end of my first year, I hope to have a clearer sense of direction and a solid foundation to build on.

I’ve been programming since I was 15, starting out with HTML, CSS, and Java. That early exposure taught me how much I enjoy solving problems and creating things from the ground up. While Python is new to me, it doesn’t feel completely unfamiliar, and I’m excited to take on new challenges with it. Throughout the year, I’ll be pushing myself to grow, experiment, and share my progress.

A bit about me:

I love live theatre, especially when I get the chance to see a good musical

I play guitar and drums, and music in general is a huge part of my life

I enjoy good food (maybe a little too much)

I like staying active and working out - it keeps me grounded
